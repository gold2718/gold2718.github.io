    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Add sugar to water and heat until it is about 105<sup>o</sup>
        F.
      </li>
      <li>Add yeast to water and stir. Allow to sit until yeast is fully awake
        (nice head of foam on top).
      </li>
      <li>Measure flours into mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Add yeast mixture and eggs (beaten) to flour.
      </li>
      <li>Knead by hand as if making bread. Add water as neccessary (should
        use most of the water). Dough may be too sticky to use hands,
        using a spoon or spatula is okay.
      </li>
      <li>When the dough is almost ready, knead in the salt (if any).
      </li>
      <li>Allow dough to sit covered in a warm environment for about 1.5 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375<sup>o</sup>. Don't forget pizza stone if you use one.
      </li>
      <li>Divide dough in three (about 200g per pie) and roll out each
      piece until it fits a 9" pizza pan. Use parchment paper to avoid
      sticking
      </li>
      <li>Prebake pizza crust for 10-15 minutes. Remove and cool slightly.
      <li>Add ingredients as desired (simple suggestion sauce then cheese).
      </li>
      <li>Bake pies for about 12 minutes. Bake directly on stone for crispiest
        crust. Use a pan with holes for a medium crust and a full-bottom pan for
        softer crust.
      </li>
      <li>Remove pie, slice and eat!
      </li>
    </ol>

      <li>Punch the dough and divide in two. Knead a little to increase firmness
        (but not so much that it won't roll out).
      </li>
      <li>Roll out each piece until it fits a 9" pizza pan.
