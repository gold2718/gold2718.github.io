<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<table border="border">
<tr><th>Ingredient</th><th>Amount</th></tr>
<tr><td>Teff flour</td><td>1/2 cup</td>

</table>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Combine teff flour and water in bowl. If
  using <a href="#Starter">starter</a>, add half of the starter to the
  mixture. If you are making a larger batch, you might need a longer
  fermentation time to get a good dough. Be sure
  to <a href="#refresh">refresh your starter</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Mix in a dash of salt (if desired).
  </li>
  <li>Let sit for several hours covered with breathable material.
  </li>
  <li>When the mixture is proofed (plenty of bubbles forming), bring
  1/4 cup water to boil in a small saucepan. Stir in 1/8 cup of the
  injera batter, whisking until it thickens.
  </li>
  <li>Stir the heated mixture back into the batter and also add water
  until the batter has the desired consistency (something close to
  crepe batter). The final mix should be able to be easily poured into
  the pan.
  </li>
  <li>Heat a skillet to medium. Some people use non-stick pans, I use
  both a stainless steel skillet with a light coating of olive oil
  spray and a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet with a light coating of
  olive oil.
  </li>
  <li>Pour batter into the skillet in a spiral pattern starting from
  the outside and working towards the center. This pouring technique
  seems to work better than trying to tilt the pan to spread the batter.
  </li>
  <li>The batter should form bubbles that pop. Once they pop, cover the
  pan and take it off the heat for a 2-3 minutes. Be careful to not
  let any condensation drip into the pan which can make the injera
  gummy and/or soggy. Remove and serve warm.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat with more batter taking care to recoat the pan if necessary.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Starter">Starter (levain)</h2>
<p>To speed up the fermentation of new batches of injera, you can
  maintain a Teff flour sourdough starter. Follow these directions.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Combine 1 cup teff flour with 1.5 cups water in a bowl.
  </li>
  <li>Let sit for 2-5 days until bubbles form. Check once or twice
    daily and if any dark liquid forms, pour it off before remixing.
  </li>
  <li>When mixture has bubbles and starts getting a nice, sour smell,
    place in jar and refrigerate.
  </li>
  <li>Maintain starter by pouring off any dark liquid that forms and
    refreshing every few days (at least once a week).
  </li>
  <li id="refresh">To refresh starter, remove part of starter (use for
  making batch of injera) and replace with fresh ingredients (1.5
  parts water to 1 part teff). Alternatively, remove add all the
    starter, mix with fresh ingredients (same ratio), and replace
  original amount after mixing.
