Simmer the apple cubes with the water, sugar, cinnamon, water and rum

evaporated. Check if you want to add more sugar and put it aside.<br />-

<st1:metricconverter productid="23 cm" st="on">23
cm</st1:metricconverter> /9 in but I usually don't worry about things
like that as I never check the time but use a wooden stick to see if the
cake is ready. Anyway, flatten out the batter and add the apple compost
evenly over it, sprinkle the grated coconut on top and then cover with
the rest of the batter.<br />- Bake it in a preheated oven (175° C /347°
F) for about 30 minutes.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
